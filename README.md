- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AwesomeLlama05

- Working on roughly modelling a chemical plant.

- Interested in learning web-dev, for maintaining the Imperial College ChemEng Wiki (and Communal Library)
- Interested in learning methods in bioprocess simulation, for animal cell culture scale-up.
- Wonders why we haven't gotten good biofuels yet, worries the same thing might happen for other bulk bioprocesses, wants to figure out why.

- Looking to collaborate on any projects in these areas!
